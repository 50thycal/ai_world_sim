# MVP verification — 2026-10-17

## Completed before deployment

- 14 Node tests: resource conservation, actual travel/cooking requirements, raw-food health penalty,
  private observations/hearing, malformed proposal rejection, complete deterministic demo day,
  SQLite restart with the same run and recorded frames, quota failure, owner pause during inference,
  durable request budget, owner-only mutations, one-time claim, CSRF, public routes and evidence export.
- Real pinned Codex 0.163.0: isolated initialization and account/read accepted, no account inherited.
- Fake JSON-RPC transport: device-code response, model catalog, very fast successful decision,
  token usage and failed turn exercised through the actual adapter. This is not live inference.
- JavaScript syntax checks passed. Source-only publish set and git whitespace checks reviewed.

## Pending owner acceptance

- Authorize device-code login on a physical phone with the intended ChatGPT account.
- Confirm available model and create a fresh ChatGPT run. Advance one decision round (six requests).
- Confirm completed decisions, provider-reported usage, actual resource changes after travel,
  pause/resume and evidence export. Check the selected account's quota/credit settings.
- Restart the service while paused and verify both the same world and connected account survive.

No subscription inference, paid API call or model-cost benchmark has been completed by these tests.
Hosting and browser deployment checks will be recorded after the first deployment succeeds.
